// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

1. Define two variables, x and y, as a user-input float.
2. Create a prompt that displays "enter the two numbers you would like to add" that will display as soon as the code is initialized.
3. Use an input function that will allow user to enter two comma-separated numbers for the x and y variables.
4. Define a new variable z as the sum of x and y.
5. Display the value of variable z.

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

I'm going to write this without the inclusion of the quantity zero, as the purposes of our calculator will likely suffice for the non-zero including set of integers.

1. Define a variable x as the value of the user input
2. Display a message "Input a whole number"
3. Use an IF conditional subsection that follows:
	If x modulus 2 = 1, display "odd"
	Else display "even"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

I'm going to presume the knowledge of a max and min function instead of writing a long sequence of "if x>y && x>k && x>b && x>p" and so on, because that would become lengthy and redundant.

1. Display "Please enter 5 integers, separated by comma"
2. Define variables to represent the 5 user-input numbers, such as x,y,k,b,p. % Would this be more efficient with an array?%
3. Define variable avg to equal (x+y+k+b+p)/5
4. Define variable max = the max function calling on our set of variables
5. Define variable min = the min function calling on our set of variables
6. Display "The average of these values is" avg
	   "The minimum of these values is" min
	   "The maximum of these values is" max
